# snowtag1.2

This code is part of an add-in I developed for the City of Saint Paul who uses Geotab, a fleet tracking and management software and needed to identify snow-tagging vehicle location history. 

I developed an add-in button inside the Geotab platform that maps the snow-tagging vehicles in real-time and allows users to dynamically filter the map based on a snow-tagging vehicle and date. Working with the Geotab API, I developed a JavaScript mapping application that pulls and filters the Saint Paul Geotab data stream to grab the snow tagging vehicles, the date, and other information.
